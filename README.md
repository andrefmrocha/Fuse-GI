# Fuse - Graphical Interface :black_circle: :white_circle:
Fuse board game with a graphical interface

### Description
Fuse board game implemented in Prolog with a graphical interface built using WebGL.
A Prolog API was developed to allow communication between the interface and the game logic.

The game allows player vs player, player vs cpu or cpu vs cpu, with multiple levels of CPU difficulty. 
Multiple environments were created, with different board and pieces geometries.
